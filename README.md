# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting heart disease. Utilizing various ML algorithms and a dataset with heart disease patient records, this project seeks to accurately identify the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and others. The source of the dataset is [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) (or specify another source if different).

## Features
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex of the patient
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol
- ... (list other features)
- `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease

## Installation
Instructions on how to set up the project environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/heart-disease-ml.git
cd heart-disease-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
